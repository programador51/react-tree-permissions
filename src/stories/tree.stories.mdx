# Simple tree

Before explain, the `component` needs the following arguments. They will be explained down below:

```ts
export interface PropsI {
  /**
   * Schema of the root to be rendered
   */
  permissions: PermissionI[];

  /**
   * Indicates the root deepth of the "root". This should't be passed by any circustance as prop. This works
   * automacally to calculate the deepth of the "root"
   */
  level?: number;

  /**
   * Indicates what the parent element (if it has) of the element on the rooth. This is calculated automatically.
   * Doesn't need to be passed as argument
   */
  parentPermission?: null | string | number;

  /**
   * All the permissions that must be "checked" once the UI finishes to render
   */
  permissionsActive: string[];

  /**
   * If true, icons will be rendered to collapse/display the nested permissions
   */
  showExpands?: boolean;

  /**
   * This callback returns the following: Permission checked, retrived permissions and new granted permissions
   */
  onChange?: (object: onChangeI) => void;
}
```

## Example - js

```js
import TreePermissions from "react-tree-permissions";

// Or .ts , meanwhile you have an array with the structure mentioned
import schemaTree from "anyPathOfYourProject/schemaTree.js";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <TreePermissions permissions={schemaTree} />;
    </>
  );
}
```

Giving the following result

<TreePermissions permissions={schemaTree} />
